# üõ°Ô∏è AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This project is an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System designed to identify potential security threats and malicious activities in a network using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.



## üß† Introduction

With the increasing number of cyber-attacks, traditional rule-based network security systems are no longer sufficient. This project aims to leverage the power of AI to detect intrusions with higher accuracy and adaptability. The system is trained on labeled network traffic data and can classify it into normal or various types of attacks (e.g., DDoS, Probe, R2L, U2R).
